# SSB-data-analyzer
Data analyzer made in python to handle SSB data.

The plan is to get data from https://www.ssb.no, and use Python to analyze the data and produce some useful charts.

Here is the road map:
1. Create a python script to get data from https://www.ssb.no
2. Use pyplot to create a pie chart https://pythontic.com/visualization/charts/piechart
